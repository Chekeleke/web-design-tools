  <p>Ray Barone is a successful sports writer and family man who deals with a brother and parents -- who happen to live
    across the street. Mom Marie loves to meddle in his life, while older brother Robert sometimes resents his success,
    and Dad Frank just makes comments and raids the fridge. Nevertheless, Ray manages to keep a bright outlook and a
    sense of humor, leaving the hard issues to his more-practical wife, Debra.</p>

    slothful ones - begin migrating south . The story revolves around sub-zero heroes: a woolly mammoth, a saber-toothed
    tiger, a sloth and a prehistoric combination of a squirrel and rat, known as Scrat.</p>

  <p>Leo Russo (Ray Romano) lives a simple life in Queens, New York with his wife Angela (Laurie Metcalf), their shy but
    talented son "Sticks" (Jacob Ward), and Leoâ€™s close-knit network of Italian-American relatives and neighborhood
    friends. Happy enough working at the family construction business alongside his father (Tony Lo Bianco) and younger
    brother (Sebastian Maniscalco), Leo lives each week for Sticks' high-school basketball games, never missing a chance
    to cheer on his only child as he rules the court as a star athlete. When the high-school senior gets a surprising
    and life-changing opportunity to play basketball in college, Leo jumps at the chance to provide a plan for his
    future, away from the family construction business. But when sudden heartbreak threatens to derail Sticks, Leo goes
    to unexpected lengths to keep his son on this new path.</p>
