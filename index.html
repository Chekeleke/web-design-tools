      <p>Romano was born in Queens, New York City, the second son of Luciana "Lucie" (née Fortini), a piano teacher,
        and
        Albert Romano, a real estate agent and engineer. He is of Italian descent. He grew up in the
        Forest Hills neighborhood of Queens. He has an older brother, Richard (born 1956), a sergeant with the NYPD,
        and a younger brother, Robert (born c. 1966), a second grade teacher in New York City.</p>

      <p>Romano attended elementary and middle school at Our Lady Queen of Martyrs in Forest Hills. After transferring
        from
        Archbishop Molloy High School, Romano graduated from Hillcrest High School in 1975. He was in the same high

      <p>Romano started performing stand-up comedy in the early 1990s. He quickly gained a following, and he was soon
        invited to appear on The Late Show with David Letterman. His appearance on Letterman led to him landing the
        role
        of Ray Barone on the CBS sitcom Everybody Loves Raymond.</p>

      <p>Everybody Loves Raymond ran for nine seasons from 1996 to 2005. The show was a critical and commercial
        success,
        and it won numerous awards, including two Emmy Awards for Romano. Romano's portrayal of Ray Barone was a major
        factor in the show's success. He brought a relatable and down-to-earth quality to the role, and he made Ray
        Barone a character that audiences could easily root for. Romano returned to television as a record promoter in
        HBO's short-lived Vinyl (2016), about the 1970s music scene in New York City,</p>
